# About the project
There are several personal finance apps currently out there that offer some form of income/expense tracking, budgeting,
and net worth tracking. I have tried many of them for varying amounts of time but have never stuck with one for too long.
They tend to be pricey, and part of that is because they use various data aggregators like Plaid -- which I have several
security concerns with. Almost all data aggregators like Plaid have gotten in trouble for selling user data, and to me
that is not worth the price these personal finance apps charge.

I believe the best solution for a personal finance app is a self-hosted app where you are in control of your data
and can customize based on what works best for you. When using Bloom Finance, you can either set up the Gmail API with
read-only permissions on your Gmail to automate getting your spending transactions or enter transactions manually if
you want to maintain maximum control over your spending data.
